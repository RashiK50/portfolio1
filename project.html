            <p>Developed a Streamlit-based web application aimed at supporting individuals experiencing
                mental stress. The app integrates the Gemini API for generating personalized mental health
                content and the Google Maps API to locate nearby mental health centers. It features
                resources like counseling links, support groups, and attractive charts to visualize mental
                health data, providing users with comprehensive support and guidance.</p>

            <p>One of my first and most basic projects is a Secret Santa Form, created to make gift exchanges more personalized and enjoyable. The form collects essential details like name, gender, address, hobbies, and special wishes, ensuring thoughtful gift-giving. This project holds a special place in my journey as a developer, as it helped me learn the fundamentals of form creation and user interaction.</p>
